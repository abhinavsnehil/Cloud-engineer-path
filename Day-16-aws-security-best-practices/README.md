## Shared Responsibility Model
- AWS secures the cloud infrastructure
- Customer secures data, applications, and access

## IAM Best Practices
- Least privilege access
- Use roles instead of access keys
- Enable MFA
- Rotate credentials regularly

## Network Security
- Use VPC for isolation
- Private subnets for sensitive resources
- Restrict public access

## Security Groups
- Stateful firewall
- Controls inbound and outbound traffic
- Applied at instance level

## Network ACLs
- Stateless firewall
- Applied at subnet level
- Provides additional security layer

## Encryption
- Encryption at rest using KMS
- Encryption in transit using SSL/TLS

## Practical Tasks
- Reviewed IAM policies
- Compared Security Groups and NACLs
- Evaluated encryption options

## Key Takeaways
- Security is a shared responsibility
- Defense in depth improves protection
