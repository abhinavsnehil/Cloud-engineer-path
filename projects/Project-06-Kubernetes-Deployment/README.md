Project 06 – Kubernetes Deployment (EKS)

Overview:-

This project demonstrates deploying a scalable web application using Kubernetes.

The architecture is designed to run on Amazon EKS or any Kubernetes cluster.

Objectives:-

• Deploy containerized application

• Enable high availability using replicas

• Expose service using LoadBalancer

• Implement namespace isolation

Technologies Used:-

• Kubernetes

• Docker

• Nginx

• YAML

• AWS EKS (Architecture)

Deployment Flow:-

• Namespace created

• Deployment created with 3 replicas

• Service exposes application via LoadBalancer

• Traffic distributed across pods

Key Learnings:-

• Kubernetes objects (Deployment, Service, Namespace)

• Replica scaling

• Service types

• Production-ready architecture design

🌍Real-World Usage

Used in:

Microservices applications

SaaS platforms

Cloud-native production environments
